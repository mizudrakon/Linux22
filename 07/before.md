# Before class quiz (#7)

The quiz has to be submitted to your GitLab project before your lab starts.

Every question is worth 25 points.

Insert your answer inside the marked block (replace the ellipsis).



## Question Q1

Briefly describe what was the most difficult or challenging part of the
previous lab for you.

Your answer: **[A1]** I'm yet to attempt the Graded tasks, but this had to be done now, so I can't really say. Finding time to do stuff now is the hardest. **[/A1]**



## Question Q2

Assume that we have a file `test.txt` for which `ls -l` prints the following:

```text
-rw-r----- 1 bjorn ursidae 13 Mar 21 14:54 test.txt
```

Which of the following users will be able to read the contents of the file?

1. `bjorn` in group `ursidae`
2. `bjorn` in groups `carnivora` and `mammalia`
3. `iorek` in group `ursidae`
4. `iorek` in groups `carnivora` and `mammalia`
5. `root` (the superuser)
6. everybody

Your answer: **[A2]** 1, 2, 3, 5 **[/A2]**



## Question Q3

Consider that the file from the previous example is stored within
the directory `/data` with the following permissions as printed by `ls -l`:

```text
rwxrwx-wx 3 bjorn ursidae 4096 Mar 21 14:53 data
```

Which of the following users will be able to delete the file?

1. `bjorn` in group `ursidae`
2. `bjorn` in groups `carnivora` and `mammalia`
3. `iorek` in group `ursidae`
4. `iorek` in groups `carnivora` and `mammalia`
5. `root` (the superuser)
6. everybody

You can assume that the root directory `/` is readable and executable
by everybody.

Your answer: **[A3]** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 **[/A3]**



## Question Q4

Continuing with the previous questions, which commands can be used to make
the file `test.txt` readable and writeable only to the owner and nobody else?

1. `chmod u=rw test.txt`
2. `chmod =rw test.txt`
3. `chmod g= test.txt`
4. `chmod o= test.txt`
5. `chmod g=,o= test.txt`
6. `chmod g-r test.txt`
7. `chmod g-rwx test.txt`

Your answer: **[A4]** 1, 2, 5, 6 **[/A4]**
