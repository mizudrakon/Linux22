Get contents of all files in subdirectory `login` that
start with a decimal digit, ends with `z.txt` and the middle letter is
any letter (i.e., A to Z, not numbers) from your GitLab login
(in lowercase).

For example, if your login is `johndoe`, you should paste contents from files
`0jz.txt`, `1ez.txt` but not from `ajz.txt` or `2wz.txt` or
`0jx.txt`.

Sort the list of files alphabetically before getting their content, duplicate
letters should be ignored (i.e., use wildcards naturally and you will be fine).


**Q1** Paste the contents of the files here.

**[A1]** luvdeluvdeluvdeluvdeluvdeluvde **[/A1]**


**Q2** Insert here the wildcard pattern that you have used.

**[A2]** [0-9][kotasekj]z.txt **[/A2]**
